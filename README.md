# Bike-sharing

## CitiBike Deliverable 1 Overview
To finalize the analysis for the proposal of bike-sharing in Des Moines, IA, the NYC CitiBike data was converted to create visualations to show the trip data by hour, and day of the week. These visualizations were added to support the business proposal. 

  - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Pandas was used to convert the tripduration column from an integer to a datetime, then the data was exported to a csv file to prepare the visualizations in tableau.

This is beneficial for bike availblility and number of bikes that need to be available, however, it must also be noted that the heaviest times for bike-sharing trips is during the morning and afternoon weekday commute hours.
